##Interactive data visualization for CS3300/INFO5100 for Project 2

- I think it would be easier to read if scripts are placed in JS file instead of straight into index.html
- To edit styling, just edit the _theme.scss file within the sass folder; no need to go into style.css file (pretty daunting). 
- This is just the layout, general stuff for the site, looks like a lot but its not. Allows us to just focus on our data and code for now.
